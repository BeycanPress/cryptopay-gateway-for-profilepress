### What does this plugin do?

The blockchain and crypto ecosystem is growing day by day. Many people doing business in this industry are also building communities, selling training, and building platforms. If you have done one of these on WordPress, for example, you are selling memberships with ProfilePress and you want to sell these memberships by receiving payment with cryptocurrency.

"This plugin is exactly what you are looking for". Because CryptoPay is the only plugin that offers crypto payment support for ProfilePress.

### How does it work?

First of all, you must have one of the Lite or Premium versions of CryptoPay. Because this is an integration plugin. Of course, ProfilePress must also be installed. After activating CryptoPay, you need to go to the payment area in your ProfilePress settings and add CryptoPay as a payment option. 

As you can see in the pictures, you can then start receiving crypto payments directly with ProfilePress.
