### Cryptocurrency Payment Gateway for ProfilePress by CryptoPay

Hello, do you sell memberships with ProfilePress on your WordPress site? Do you also have customers or services related to the crypto ecosystem? So, do you want to accept **<a href="https://beycanpress.com/cryptopay/?utm_source=wporg_readme&utm_medium=cryptopay_pp">crypto payments</a>** on your website or sell your memberships in crypto with ProfilePress?

If the answer to all these questions is yes, you are in the right place. Because CryptoPay is developed entirely for WordPress and supports 15+ WordPress plugins like ProfilePress. (Has WooCommerce payment gateway built-in)

With CryptoPay, you can receive crypto payments that are completely peer-to-peer (that is, your customers pay directly to your wallet, without any intermediary processes) and commission-free (yes, completely zero commission).

This integration plugin will work with both the paid version and the free (CryptoPay Lite). In this way, you can use whatever you want according to your needs.
